## Hello, I'm Luis! 🌟  

I'm a passionate **Software Engineering student** at **Florida Gulf Coast University**, driven by the art of building innovative solutions. With a strong foundation in technologies like **.NET Framework** and **Next.js**, I enjoy creating seamless, modern front-end experiences paired with robust, high-performing back-ends.  

### Why Software Engineering?  
For me, software development is more than just writing code; it's about problem-solving, creativity, and transforming ideas into impactful applications. Whether it's optimizing a backend service or designing an intuitive user interface, I strive to deliver value through clean, efficient, and scalable code.  

### My Aspirations 🎯  
I'm currently seeking an internship that aligns with my skills and ambitions, where I can contribute to impactful projects while learning from industry professionals. If you're looking for a dedicated and adaptable team member, I'd love to connect!
