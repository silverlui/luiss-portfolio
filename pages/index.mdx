## hey! it's luis ðŸš€

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer at Florida Gulf Coast University. Eager to dive into the professional world, 
I am actively seeking an internship that align with my aspirations.
I primarly enjoy working with `.NET Framework` and `Next.js`.
I love crafting beautiful front-end experiences as well as a stable and perfomant back-end.
