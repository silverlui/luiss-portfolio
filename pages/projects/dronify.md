## [Dronify Zero Trust Project](https://github.com/NielPatelSE12/zero_trust_project)
A microservices security architecture that implements a zero-trust approach, emphasizing the principle of “never trust, 
always verify.”

### Purpose
This project demonstrates how to secure microservices through a **zero-trust** model, enforcing authentication and 
encryption at every layer to protect data in transit and at rest. It also utilizes Docker for containerization, ensuring 
consistent and portable deployments.

### Technologies
- **Python**  
- **Docker**  
- **Zero-Trust Architecture** (policy enforcement, logging, real-time monitoring)
